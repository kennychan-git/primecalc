# Prime Number Checker and Factorizer
This Python script allows you to check if a given positive integer is a prime number. If the number is not prime, it also provides the factors of that number.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
multiprocessing module

time module

## Usage
1.Clone the repository or download the script file. 
2.Open the terminal or command prompt. 
3.Navigate to the directory where the script is located. 
4.Run the script using the following command:
>python prime_checker.py
5.Enter a positive integer when prompted.
6. The script will output whether the number is prime or not, along with its factors (if applicable).
7.The elapsed time to execute the computation will also be displayed.

>Enter a positive integer to check if it is a prime number: 20 
>20 is not a prime number. 
>Factors of 20: [1, 20, 2, 10, 4, 5] 
>Number of factors: 6 
>Time elapsed: 0.0012357234954833984 seconds.
